    Holderness is an area in the East Riding of Yorkshire in England’s north-eastern coast, spanning 61 kilometres (38 miles) from Farmborough to Spur Point. Holderness is Europe’s fastest eroding coastline, losing 2 meters (or 7-10 metres in a stormy year) and approximately 2 million tonnes of land annually. The area has lost roughly 5 kilometres (3 miles) of land and 23 villages since Roman Times.

<font size='6'><b>Longshore Drift</font></b>

    <br><br>
</center>
Longshore drift occurs when the prevailing wind direction approaches a beach at an angle, causing waves in this direction. The waves then move sediments up the beach at this angle (swash) before the waves move this sediment back down at a right angle due to gravity (backwash). This causes a net movement of sediment along the beach.
<br><br>
<font size='6'><b>Cliff faces can be eroded by waves in several ways.</font></b>
<br><br>
Hydraulic action – The force of waves crashing against a cliff causes materials to be dislodged.
<br><br>
Compression – Air in cracks of the rocks is trapped by rising tides. As waves attack the cliff, this air is compressed and decompressed, causing the crack to propagate and rock pieces to break off. 
<br><br>
Abrasion – Materials carried by waves grind against cliffs, causing their material to break.
<br><br>
Solution – Sea water dissolves certain types of rock (like chalk)
<br><br>
<font size='6'><b>How does Holderness erode?</font></b>
<br><br>
Rainwater saturates and weakens the area’s till. The cliff’s high angle then allows mass movement with erosion accelerating this process. This reduces the cliff’s angle, preventing further erosion. However, longshore drift caused by large waves from the Northeast transport debris South (3% of Holderness’ eroded material being moved to Spur Point), steepening the cliff and allowing further erosion.

            Holderness consists of bedrock made of cretaceous chalk, which, in many areas, is covered by till that erodes easily. Furthermore, strong prevailing winds create high energy destructive waves with fetches of 500km – 800 km across the North Sea, with currents moving into the North Sea that add more energy to these waves. Holderness also often experiences intense storms, creating strong winds that add to the waves’ energy. Winds and low-pressure areas from these storms also cause storm surges, where wave height increases, allowing them to better attack the coast’s cliffs. Furthermore, the area’s narrow beaches also don’t reduce the waves’ power much. These factors exaggerate the coastline’s erosion.

   In 1991, 2 rock groynes were constructed. These are lines of stone perpendicular to the shoreline, extending into the shoreface. They trap sediment moved from longshore drift, widening the beach so it can better absorb wave energy. Additionally, a 450-metre long revetement was also built: a sloping structure of Norwegian granite blocks whose large surface area and air spaces effectively dissipate wave energy. Gabions are metal wired-cages consisting of materials such as granite, gravel, rock or sandstone that form a wall before a cliff. Their slight flexibility and air spaces allow them to absorb and reflect wave energy. These have been used in Skipsea. These projects cost $2 million and were established to protect 300 houses threatened by erosion and the B1242 road, which connected much of Holderness. In 1906, concrete seawalls were also constructed in Hornsea, which have a curved face that deflect waves back into sea.

        In Mappleton, Hornsea and Withernsea, beach nourishment has been used, which is the placement of sand to widen beaches so that they better absorb the waves’ energy and reduce coastal erosion. This practice conserves the beach’s appearance; however, it is an expensive process that must be repeated regularly. Furthermore, the angle of Mappleton’s cliffs was reduced and vegetation was also planted along it. This vegetation creates root systems that bond soil and rock together and absorbs moisture, preventing mass movement.  Managed retreat is the coordinated evacuation of people and infrastructure threatened by erosion. Managed retreat was proposed for Hornsea in 1994 where settlers would receive grants and buyouts if they relocated. Furthermore, nothing is being done to preserve parts of Spur point because it has no permanent residents. The area’s designation as a nature reserve also limits the coastal management strategies that can be used.

    The hard engineering scheme has reduced Mappleton’s erosion rates from around 2 metres per year to 0.3 metres per year, effectively protecting the village and the B1242 road. The rock groynes have widened Mapleton’s beaches, preventing waves at high tide from attacking its cliffs. The revetment has had a similar effect, protecting the south of the village. Furthermore, there has been no mass movement for 25 years after in the area where vegetation has been planted along the cliff and its slope was reduced. However, the area directly south of the rock groynes now suffer terminal groyne syndrome. Longshore drift continues to move sediment away from this area’s beaches but the groynes prevent Mappleton’s sediment to be deposited here. This shrinks the area’s beaches, making them unable to absorb the waves’ energy and accelerating erosion. This has caused erosion rates exceed 10 metres/ year in some areas and the loss of several farms, including Grange Farm and Cowden Farm.
